<b> This repo is a Weather Forecasting System GUI application using LSTMs 
 </b>
 
 <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Inside the project you the notebook Lstms_weather_forecasting.ipynb  in which we have built the model</li>
    <li>All the datas preprocessing steps, Building of the LSTM Models and evaluation are inside </li>
    <li>We have also put our model in production using pyqt5 to build a friendly GUI, to permit anybody to use our model  without knowing anything about python or Artificial intelligence</li>
